# HOI4 Province Editor
My fork of ScottyThePilot's HOI4PE to support resolution change, the lazy, unsafe and once per launch way.
Maybe I will rework it to support actual resizing while running one day, but I don't know Rust and I am also lazy.

## Manually Building
1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone this repository to a folder and navigate there in your terminal
3. Run `cargo build --release` in that folder, wait for it to complete
4. The resulting executable should be located in `/target/release`
